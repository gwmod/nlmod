    "\n",
    "In nlmod we use a specific caching method called [memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization). The memoization is implemented in the `nlmod` caching module. The `cache_netcdf` decorator function handles most of the magic for caching netcdf files. When the cache is created all function arguments are stored in a dictionary and saved (pickled) as a .pklz file. The check on function arguments (step 2A) is done by reading the pickle and comparing the output with the arguments of the current function call.\n"
   ]

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All function arguments are pickled and saved together with the netcdf file. If the function arguments use a lot of memory this process can be become slow. This should be taken into account when you decide to use caching.\n",
    "2. Function arguments that cannot be pickled using the `pickle` module raise an error in the caching process.\n",
    "3. If one of the function arguments is an xarray Dataset the argument check is somewhat different. Not all the data in a dataset it checked as it would take to much time. Therefore we use the `nlmod.cache.ds_contains` function to specify which coordinates, data variables and attributes should be checked. The arguments for this are specified in the cache decorator.\n",
    "4. There is a check to see if the module where the function is defined has been changed since the cache was created. This helps not to use the cache when changes are made to the function. Unfortunately when the function uses other functions from different modules these other modules are not checked for recent changes.\n",
    "5. The `cache_netcdf` decorator uses `functools.wraps` and some homemade magic to add properties, such as the name and the docstring, of the original function to the decorated function. This assumes that the original function has a docstring with a \"Returns\" heading. If this is not the case the docstring is not modified.\n",
    "6. There are some additional options for caching in the NLMOD_CACHE_OPTIONS. The options are:\n",
    "    - `nc_hash`: Save a hash of the stored netcdf file with the function arguments to ensure that the stored netcdf file and the pickled function arguments belong together. Default is True\n",
    "    - `dataset_coords_hash`: Save a hash of the dataset coordinates with the function arguments and check against the dataset coordinates that are used to call the function. This is to ensure that the cached file was created using the same dataset coordinates as the current function call, default is True.\n",
    "    - `dataset_data_vars_hash`: Save a hash of the data variables with the function arguments and check against the dataset variables that are used to call the function. This is to ensure that the cached file was created using the same dataset variables as the current function call, default is True.\n",
    "    - `explicit_dataset_coordinate_comparison`: If the `dataset_coords_hash` and `dataset_data_vars_hash` do not work (for example see this issue: https://github.com/gwmod/nlmod/issues/389) it is adviced to use an explicit check to see if the cached file was created using the same dataset coordinates as the current function call. This can be done with this settings, the default is False."

    "\n",
    "Many memoization methods use a hash of the function arguments as the filename. Thus creating multiple files for different function calls. The memoization in `nlmod` uses a user-defined filename (`cachename`) to store the cache. If the function is called with different arguments the previous cached file is overwritten. By not creating a new file for every unique set of function arguments we reduce the number of files and therefore the memory size on the disk. By saving the function output as netCDF file it is also possible to read the file seperately from the caching process. While this is not something you would often do it can help when debugging. "
